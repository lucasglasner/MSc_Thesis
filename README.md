## Thesis Repository

#### Simple description of the repository.

In this github repository you will encounter all the figures used in my MSc. Thesis, including all the processing scripts and procedures used 
to generate them. Aditionally you will found not only scripts for different tasks, but files related with my inner progress in the project, such 
as advance presentations, reports, and all kind of miscellaneous stuff. Finally, almost all 
scripts are programmed to open and store data in a "data folder" (heavy) not completely included in this repository.
